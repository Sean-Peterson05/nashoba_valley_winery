                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p> While the vision started in 1976, Nashoba Valley Winery was born in 1978 when founder Jack Partridge’s interest in fruit wines exceeded 
                   his fascination with being a city planning for the City of Cambridge. After producing wines out of his house for 2 years, he rented space in a West Concord mill building called Damon Mill. 
                   By 1980, as the business expanded, so did Partridge’s desire to locate in an orchard, where he could grow a wide assortment of fruits for the wines. 
                   In 1983 Partridge found just the spot in Bolton which at the time was known as Upland Farm. The property included a rustic farmhouse which was built in 1923 
                   and was originally owned by Dr. Clemens, a chiropractor.  In 1983 Jack Partridge purchased the property, built the original wine shop, 
                   replanted the orchard and established Nashoba Valley Winery & Orchard. From 1983 until 1995, Jack Partridge lived with his family in the 
                   farmhouse until it was sold to its current owners, Rich and Cindy Pelletier. In 1995, the concept of grown locally was starting to be 
                   developed and agritourism was a concept not a business.  With a new team in place, Nashoba began to bring west coast concept to an east coast farm. 
                   A visit had to become an experience; a place where people gather to experience open land and dirty hands. From 1995 to 1998, the transition team focused 
                   on recreating the original wines which required bringing back the original winemaker, Larry Ames.  Rich Pelletier remembers being told by 
                   Bob Davis, a big-league farmer in Bolton, that to rebuild the winery’s image required him to bring back Larry to make the wines. Today, 
                   Nashoba Valley Winery is Massachusetts’s leading fruit wine producer and the nation’s pioneering “winery orchard.” With over 100 national 
                   and international medals to its credit and accolades from such noteworthy publications as “Boston Magazine”, “Wine Enthusiast”, 
                   “Cooking Lite Magazine”, “Food and Wine”, “Boston Parent’s Paper”, “The Yankee Magazine” 2003 Editors Choice, Travel & Leisure, 
                   Nashoba Valley Winery is one of the ultimate destinations on the east coast.</p>
